###SubGit Documentation
Here are three basic tasks one may use SubGit for. Follow links below to get detailed documentation. In case something is not clear or you experience a difficulty,
do not hesitate to contact us at [support@subgit.com](mailto:support@subgit.com) email address.
#####1. [Mirror Remote Subversion Repository](remote-book.html)
Create a Git repository that will mirror remote Subversion repository accessible over network. Translation from Git to Subversion is initiated on push operation and translation from Subversion to Git is performed asynchronously in background.
#####2. [Mirror Local Subversion Repository](book.html)
Install SubGit into Subversion repository on the server side. Both Subversion and Git repositories reside on the same server. Translation in both directions is initiated instantly and introduces minimal overhead.
#####3. [One Time Import from Subversion to Git](remote-book.html#7)
Perform one-time import of an existing Subversion project into Git. No synchronization is required.

###[SubGit for Atlassian Bitbucket Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.tmatesoft.subgit.stash-svn-importer)
For [Atlassian Bitbucket Server](https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash) Git repositories management tool (formerly known as Atlassian Stash) we offer SubGit wrapped as an add-on. Visit [SVN Mirror Add-On for Bitbucket Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.tmatesoft.subgit.stash-svn-importer) page for more details. Follow instructions on creating bi-directional mirror of your existing Subversion project and importing your Subversion project into Bitbucket Server ([continue](stash.html)).

###[Comparison to Git-Svn](documentation/gitsvn.html)
From the very beginning, SubGit was developed as an alternative to [Git-Svn](http://schacon.github.com/git/git-svn.html), so quite naturally SubGit does resolve many of the Git-Svn limitations ([continue](documentation/gitsvn.html)).

###[SubGit Release Notes](documentation/release-notes.html)
Brief information on SubGit versions history and new features available in each version since version 1.0 ([continue](documentation/release-notes.html)).

###[SubGit Registration](documentation/register.html)
Without a registration you may use SubGit for evaluation purposes as long as you like.
For production use choose from Free, Commercial or Open Source registration options, [obtain registration key](pricing.html) and follow [registration instructions](documentation/register.html).
