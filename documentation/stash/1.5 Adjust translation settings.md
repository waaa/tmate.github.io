###1.5 Adjust translation settings

There are four options of how authors mapping will be going on.

At first, you could specify matches manually at **Authors Mapping** tab.
If this wouldn't be present or there should be no match, add-on will try to find Git authors using SVN username among registered users.
If that wouldn't be the case, global authors mapping scheme is to be used.
You can also change your default e-mail domain here.

By following the **global authors mapping** link you'll get to the Global Subversion Mirror Settings. Here in the similiar text field you can specify global authors mapping settings which would work for all of your repositories.

Find more details on authors mapping and SVN credentials processing at dedicated [documentation page](http://subgit.com/stash/import/authors.html).

Translation settings could be set if you ran the import at least for one time.
You can specify the start revision and decide if you need to track changes in .gitattributes or .gitignore files.
