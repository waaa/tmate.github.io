###5.9. Adjust configuration: other options

    [svn]
    ...
    minimalRevision = 1024

Set svn.minimalRevision to Subversion revision from which translation should be started. Revisions older than specified would not be translated and would not be present in the Git repository. Limiting range of revisions with this option may reduce initial translation time.
    
    [core]
    subgit configure --shared-daemon PATH REPO

By running this command it's possible to specify the daemon configuration for running shared polling process, receiving new changes from Subversion repositories and translates them to Git repositories in the background.

    [daemon "shared"]
    path = /path/to/shared/daemon/dir

There's also an option to add this to the already existing config file so after running 

    subgit install

no additional daemon would start, only main and shared would be present. To run the daemon following commands should be used:

    subgit daemon
    subgit daemon --help

One will find more options in the subgit/config file, as well as documentation on what these options control.
