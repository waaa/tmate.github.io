###3.3. Authors Mapping
By default there is no explicit authors mapping and the following rules are used for translation:

+ Subversion "svn\_user\_name" is translated to "svn\_user\_name <>" in Git
+ Git "Author Name \<email@domain.com\>" is translated to "Author Name" in Subversion

Additionally to the default rule, explicit authors mapping may be provided by SubGit configuration. Authors mapping is stored in a separate text file which is looked at GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt by default. Mapping file is read in system default encoding.
Authors mapping file (authors.txt) contents may be altered at any time and new mapping becomes effective immediately.

**Figure 3.9. GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt file**

    svn_user_name = Git Name <name@email.com>

Default authors.txt location may be changed in SubGit configuration file.

**Figure 3.10. SubGit configuration file defines authors.txt location**

    [core]
    ...
    # location of the authors mapping file
    authorsFile = subgit/authors.txt
    ...

There is also an option using authors mapping script. Script is expected to provide the following mappings:

    Git author name and email => Subversion user name
    Subversion user name => Git author name and email

Script reads values from the standard input and, depending on the values, it outputs either full Git author name and email or short Subversion user name.

Input/Output protocol:

    Input:
    FULL NAME
    EMAIL
    Output:
    SHORT_SVN_NAME

    Input:
    SHORT_SVN_NAME
    Output:
    FULL NAME
    EMAIL

Authors mapping script may be used instead or together with the static authors mapping.

Script that implements Input/Output protocol described above could be specified as a value of core.authorsFile configuration option in SubGit configuration file with optional arguments:

    [core]

    authorsFile = /path/to/mappingScript [args]
    authorsFile = /path/to/staticMappingFile.txt

Script is always executed in the repository root directory.
