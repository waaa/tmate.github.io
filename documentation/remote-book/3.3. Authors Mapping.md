###3.3. Authors Mapping
By default there is no explicit authors mapping and the following rules are used for translation:

+ Subversion "svn\_user\_name" is translated to "svn\_user\_name <>" in Git
+ Git "Author Name \<email@domain.com\>" is translated to "Author Name" in Subversion

Additionally to the default rule, explicit authors mapping may be provided by SubGit configuration. Authors mapping is stored in a separate text file which is looked at GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt by default. Mapping file is read in system default encoding.

**Figure 3.9. GIT_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt file**

    svn_user_name = Git Name <name@email.com>

Default authors.txt location may be changed in SubGit configuration file.

**Figure 3.10. SubGit configuration file defines authors.txt location**

    [core]
    ...
    # location of the authors mapping file
    authorsFile = subgit/authors.txt
    ...

Authors mapping file (authors.txt) contents may be altered at any time and new mapping becomes effective immediately.
