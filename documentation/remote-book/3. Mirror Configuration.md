##Chapter 3. Mirror Configuration Overview

To synchronize Subversion and Git repositories, SubGit maps entities of one system to those of another. One Git repository is always mapped to a single project within Subversion repository. There could be from one to many projects in Subversion repository. Git repository contains SubGit configuration that defines the following information and mappings:

+ Subversion project location within Subversion repository
+ Subversion project branches and tags are mapped to the Git branch and tag references
+ Subversion users are mapped to the Git committers

Above mappings are static and configured within Git repository once before translation and synchronization is started. All mappings and other information is stored in configuration files located in the GIT_REPOS/subgit directory. Following sections describe these mappings in more details.

> **Note:**<br>
> Subversion is a very powerful system and sets mostly no limits on the repository and project layout. Hence, it may not be always possible to define necessary mappings for any project stored in Subversion repository found out there in the wild. Such unmappable projects would not be handled by SubGit. However, for the most of the Subversion repositories in production use, mappings could be defined and, in most cases, they are detected automatically by SubGit.
