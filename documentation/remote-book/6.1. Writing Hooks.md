###6.1. Writing Hooks

In order to enable synchronization of Subversion and Git repositories, SubGit installs hooks into Git repository. These hooks are:

+ Git pre-receive hook
+ Git post-receive hook

Presence of these hooks is crucial for SubGit to function properly, and users should never modify or remove these hook scripts. If necessary, above hooks functionality should be placed into user-\* scripts that would be called by SubGit at appropriate moments. SubGit install command takes care of already existing hooks and automatically places their contents into the corresponding user-\* script files (see Figure 5.2, “Repository after install command is completed”).

By specifying **triggerSvnPostReceive = true** in the SubGit config file you will have SubGit triggerring <GIT_REPO>/hooks/user-post-receive hook every time SubGit fetches new changes from SVN repository. The input is in standard post-receive format. Additionaly there's SVN_LAST_FETCHED_REVISION environment variable passed to the hook which stores the latest revision fetched from SVN repository.

Table below shows correspondence between standard hook scripts file names and file names that should be used to put hook functionality into after SubGit is installed. Hooks parameters and return code processing rules are not affected by SubGit. Hooks that are not listed in the table are not used by SubGit and their standard file names are not changed.

    standard hook name             hook name after SubGit is installed

    pre-receive                    user-pre-receive
    post-receive                   user-post-receive

On Windows OS .cmd or .bat extension should be added to Subversion hook file names.
