##Chapter 2. SubGit Features

Major SubGit benefits are

+ Great translation and initial import performance (in comparison to git-svn)
+ No limits are put on Svn and Git users (contrary to git-svn)
+ Requires no shell access to Subversion repository (contrary to SubGit 1.0.x)

SubGit includes powerful translation engine, which would translate

+ merge tracking information and merge history
+ non-linear Git commits history to Subversion
+ subprojects, tags and branches
+ svn:ignore and .gitignore ignore definitions
+ svn:eol-style and .gitattributes special properties
+ symbolic links
+ commit authors and dates
+ files and directories renames

There are a few limitations on translation (see [Chapter 9, Translation Limitations](#chapter9)). These limitations only affects translation, and do not prevent Git and Subversion from being used to their full extents.
