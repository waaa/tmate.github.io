###5.1. Installation Stages
To translate Subversion repository to Git and to enable bi-directional synchronization, one have to use SubGit to create and configure Git repository. Mirror creation consists of three stages: **repository creation**, **configuration adjustment** and **installation**.

At configuration stage SubGit creates Git repositories ans stored default mirror configuration into it. Then user has a chance to adjust generated configuration. At the installation stage SubGit performs actual translation of existing Subversion revisions into Git commits and then turns synchronization on. Figure 5.1 schematically shows SubGit installation stages.
