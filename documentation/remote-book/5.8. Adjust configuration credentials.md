###5.7. Adjust configuration: credentials

In order to create new revision in Subversion repository, SubGit needs credentials to authorize itself with Subversion server. SubGit user may provide multiple sets of credentials (username/password pairs) so that SubGit could choose with username to authorize with when creating new revision. There are a few sources SubGit looks for credentials:

**GIT\_REPOS/subgit/passwd file:** SubGit looks into GIT\_REPOS/subgit/passwd file to read username/password pairs. Passwords are expected to be plaintext. It is a good idea to limit file read access for this file to the user account that runs SubGit.

    username password
    username1 secret
    ...
    usernameN anothersecret

Path to the GIT\_REPOS/subgit/passwd file could be changed in SubGit configuration file:

    [auth "default"]
    ...
    passwords = subgit/passwd

**SubGit configuration file:** SSH and SSL client credentials could be defined explicitly in subgit/config configuration file:

    [auth "default"]
    ...
    sshKeyFile = /home/user/ssh-private-key.openssh
    sshKeyFilePassphrase = secret

    sslClientCertFile = /home/user/ssl-client-cert.p12
    sslClientCertPassphrase = secret

**Local Subversion credentials cache:** To make SubGit look for credentials in the local Subversion credentials cache, set auth.useDefaultSubversionConfigurationDirectory option to true and ensure that Subversion credentials cache path is correct:

    [auth "default"]
    ...
    useDefaultSubversionConfigurationDirectory = true
    subversionConfigurationDirectory = /home/user/.subversion

> **HTTP Proxy Configuration**<br>
> In case Subversion repository access requires proxy to be configured, then auth.useDefaultSubversionConfigurationDirectory must be set to true and proxy settings should be defined in Subversion servers file.
