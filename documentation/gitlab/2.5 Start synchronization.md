###2.5 Start synchronization

Now everything is ready for starting synchronization of the Git repository with the SVN repository. To start the process run

    $ subgit install kafka.git

First it will run initial translation of the SVN repository to Git. On the command completion, SubGit will start a daemon that will translate every change in the SVN repository to `kafka.git` repository and vice versa.
