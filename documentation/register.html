```

###2. Upload Registration Key to the Host where SubGit is installed.
Upload key you have received to the server where your repository is located. You may upload the file, or copy and paste key file contents to the file on the server side.

###3. Register SubGit
Register SubGit for your Git or Subversion repository by running the following command:

```
$ sudo subgit register --key subgit.key /path/to/repository
```

Note use of the `sudo` command above. Super user privileges are needed to store key securely. On Windows OS you may need to ensure that register command is run on behalf of the Administrator user.
