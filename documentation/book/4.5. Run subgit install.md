###4.5. Run subgit install

Run SubGit install command to make SubGit create Git repositories, perform initial translation from Subversion to Git and to enable synchronization.One have to run configure command on behalf of the same user account that would be used to access Subversion or Git repository. Use sudo command on Linux or OS X or Administrator account on Windows if necessary. Examples below assume Ubuntu Linux and commands are ran on behalf of www-data user that runs Apache Web Server on that system.

*install* command uses configuration previously generated by configure command or perform configuration stage itself in case pregenerated configuration is not present. Subgit *install* command output when run on a single-project Subversion repository is shown below:

    $ [sudo -u www-data] subgit install svn_repository
    SubGit version 1.0.2 ('Miai') build #1730

    Subversion to Git mapping has been found:
        <root> : /var/svn/svn_repository/.git

    Translating Subversion revisions to Git commits...

        Subversion revisions translated: 20.
        Total time: 10 seconds.

    INSTALLATION SUCCESSFUL

Initial translation may take a while, however it would not affect Subversion repository - it remains fully functional during initial translation time.

SubGit *install* command creates Git repository and enables synchronization by installing hooks. Existing Subversion pre-commit and post-commit hooks are preserved and executed normally.

As soon as *install* command reports successful termination, commits to Subversion repository will be immediately translated to the corresponding Git repository and vice versa - pushes to Git repository from its clones will be immediately translated to Subversion repository. With SubGit no special actions are required to maintain Subversion and Git repositories synchronized.
