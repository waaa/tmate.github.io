##Chapter 1. Overview

SubGit is a tool for bidirectional Subversion and Git repositories synchronization. SubGit is written in Java and works on the server side, i.e. requires direct access to both Subversion and Git repositories over local file system.

For creating a Git mirror of a **remote** Subversion repository, refer to [SubGit Remote Book]({{ site.baseurl }}/remote-book.html). This book only covers the case when SubGit is installed into existing Subversion repository.

Most commonly, SubGit user starts with Subversion repository being configured on the server. Access to Subversion repository is available over network (with HTTP(s), plain svn or svn over SSH protocols) and over the local file system. Correspondingly, users requests are handled by Apache Web Server, svnserve daemon or sshd daemon which invokes svnserve process. Figure 1.1 shows a generic outline of the described configuration.

SubGit creates one or more Git repositories alongside with the existing Subversion repository and translates existing Subversion revisions into Git commits. After that, SubGit configures Subversion and Git hook scripts so, that changes made in the Subversion repository are instantly translated into Git repository and vice versa. Figure 1.2 shows the server with SubGit being installed. SubGit grants users with a choice of using either Git or Subversion.
