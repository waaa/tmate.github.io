###3.1. Projects mapping

Subversion repository may contain one or more projects. Project is a location (folder) in Subversion repository which follows Subversion recommended repository layout, i.e. project folder has *trunk*, *branches* and *tags* subfolders:

    /project
       /trunk    # project's "main line"
       /branches # contains project feature and version branches, copied from trunk or other branches
       /tags     # contains project tags (trunk and branches snapshots)

It is not necessary for *trunk*, *branches* and *tags* folders to have these exact names, but the roles of these folders are important. Each project could be mapped to a bare Git repository as shown in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.3 along with the corresponding parts of SubGit configuration file.

**Figure 3.2. SubGit configuration file (single project mapping)**

    [git "default"]
    # project location within Subversion repository
    translationRoot = /

    # file system path of the mapped Git repository
    repository = .git

**Figure 3.4. SubGit configuration file (two projects mapping)**

    [git "project1"]
    # project location within Subversion repository
    translationRoot = /project1

    # file system path of the mapped Git repository
    repository = git/project1.git
    ...

    [git "project2"]
    # project location within Subversion repository
    translationRoot = /project2

    # file system path of the mapped Git repository
    repository = git/project2.git
