###4.2. Setup Service Accounts

> This section is only relevant for Linux and OS X users.

It is important to plan in advance what service would be used to access Git repositories and what to work with Subversion ones. Usually Subversion service is left intact and one have to configure Git service account so, that files created or modified on its behalf are readable and writable by Subversion service user and vice versa.

There are basically three possible cases in regards to the services and service accounts. All cases are shown in the diagrams below.

**Figure 4.2. One service and single user account**
![One service and single user account]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/user-same.png)

In the most convenient case the same service (Apache HTTP Server) would be used to access both Subversion and Git repositories. Apache HTTP Server user account then would be the only SubGit user (`www-data:www-data`) as shown in Figure 4.2. In this case no changes are needed.

**Figure 4.3. Different services ran on behalf of the same user**
![Different services ran on behalf of the same user]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/subgitbook/user-same2.png)

Different services may run on behalf of the same user account as in Figure 4.3. In this case there is still single SubGit user, `www-data:www-data` and no changes have to be made.

**Figure 4.4. Different services ran on behalf of different users**

When different services would be used (e.g. SSH for Git and svnserve for Subversion) and ran on behalf of the different service accounts, then *each service account must belong to all other accounts primary groups in addition to its own primary group*, like it is shown in Figure 4.4 where `svn:svn` user also belongs to the `git` group and `git:git` user also belongs to the `svn` group.

For instance, in case of the three accounts, they would belong to the following groups:

+ service1:service1, service2, service3
+ service2:service2, service1, service3
+ service3:service3, service1, service2

Following commands show how to add user to another account primary group:

    $ sudo groups svn git
    svn : svn
    git : git
    $ sudo usermod -G svn git
    $ sudo usermod -G git svn
    $ sudo groups svn git
    svn : svn git
    git : git svn

Alternatively, in Figure 4.4 scenario all accounts may share the same primary group.

To display and change user's primary group one may use the following commands:

    $ sudo groups git svn
    git : git
    svn : svn
    $ sudo usermod -g svn git
    $ sudo groups git svn
    git : svn
    svn : svn

> **Service Accounts Summary:**<br>
> It is important to ensure that all Subversion and Git repositories that are synchronized by SubGit are either:
>
> + accessed by the same system user (e.g. www-data:www-data)
> + accessed by the users who share each other primary group (e.g. svn:svn,**git** and git:git,**svn**)
> + accessed by the users who share the same primary group (e.g. svn:**svn** and git:**svn**).
>
> SubGit configuration that involves multiple user accounts is referred later in this guide as **shared**.
