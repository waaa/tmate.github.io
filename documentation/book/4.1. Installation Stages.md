###4.1. Installation Stages

To translate Subversion repository to Git and enabled synchronization, SubGit have to be installed into Subversion repository. SubGit installation consists of three stages: **automatic configuration detection**, **configuration adjustment** and **installation**.

At configuration stage SubGit detects projects and writes down mappings it has found. Then user has a chance to adjust generated configuration. At installation stage SubGit performs actual translation of existing Subversion revisions to Git commits and then turns instant synchronization on. Figure 4.1 schematically shows SubGit installation stages.
