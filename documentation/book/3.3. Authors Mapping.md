###3.3. Authors Mapping

By default there is no explicit authors mapping and the following rules are used for translation:

+ Subversion "`svn\_user\_name`" is translated to "`svn\_user\_name <>`" in Git
+ Git "`Author Name \<email@domain.com\>`" is translated to "`Author Name`" in Subversion

Additionally to the default rule, explicit authors mapping may be provided by SubGit configuration. Authors mapping is stored in a separate text file which is looked at `GIT\_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt` by default. Mapping file is read in system default encoding.

**Figure 3.9. GIT\_REPOS/subgit/authors.txt file**

    svn_user_name = Git Name <name@email.com>

Default authors.txt location may be changed in SubGit configuration file.

**Figure 3.10. SubGit configuration file defines authors.txt location**

    [core]
    ...
    # location of the authors mapping file
    authorsFile = subgit/authors.txt
    ...

Authors mapping file (authors.txt) contents may be altered at any time and new mapping becomes effective immediately.

Tip: Add author mappings for as many of you team members as possible, even if they don't use Git as the log history will be more consistent.
